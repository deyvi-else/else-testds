## 2026-10-08: Style Dictionary v4 to v5

**What changed:** CLAUDE.md now says "Style Dictionary (latest stable)" instead of "v4". The project moved from `style-dictionary@^4.4.0` to `^5.6.0`.

**Why it was safe:** The 5.0 breaking changes don't affect this repo:

- Node 22 or later is required. We run Node 24
- The reference syntax is fixed to DTCG `{group.token}`. Figma's DTCG export already uses this
- References must point at tokens, not groups. CLAUDE.md already forbids a token name that is also a group

The custom transform API (`registerTransform`, `filter`/`transform`) is the same as in v4. The planned transforms for modes, `color-mix()`, opacity decimals and typography are unaffected. Running `npm run tokens` with a test alias still outputs `var(--testds-...)`.

**What v5 makes easier:**

- 5.3 reads the DTCG 2025.10 structured colour object (`colorSpace` / `components`), which newer Figma exports can produce
- 5.4 supports the object form for dimensions (`{ "value": 4, "unit": "px" }`)

**What didn't carry over:** When there are no tokens, v4 skipped `tokens.css`, but v5 writes an empty `:root {}`. This happens because with no file `filter`, the empty-file check gets the unfiltered dictionary and doesn't treat it as empty. The config now checks for tokens itself and writes the "No tokens exported from Figma yet" placeholder. It no longer depends on Style Dictionary's empty-file behaviour. v5.5's `emitEmptyFiles` option was considered, but it controls the opposite case.
